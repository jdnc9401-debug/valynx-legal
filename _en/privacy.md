#### Usage Data

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. However, **Valynx is designed to work primarily locally**, so the collection of usage data is minimal:

- **Google Drive (Optional)**: If you choose to use the Google Drive backup functionality, OAuth 2.0 authentication is required. Access tokens are stored locally on your device. Backup files are stored in your Google Drive account under your control. **We do not access any other data from your Google Drive account**.

- **Local Notifications**: Notifications are scheduled and managed locally on your device. No data is sent to external servers for notifications.

**Important**: Valynx **does NOT collect** usage data such as IP addresses, device identifiers, browsing information, or diagnostic data, as the application works primarily offline and locally.

## Use of Your Personal Data

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: All your financial data is stored locally on your device using SQLite. We use your personal data solely to provide application functionalities, such as:

  - Calculating monthly summaries and financial analyses
  - Scheduling notifications for recurring payments and installment purchases
  - Managing budgets and savings goals
  - Generating reports and data exports

- **Service Improvement**: Using aggregated and anonymized data (if any) to improve application functionalities.

**We do not share your personal data with third parties**, except in the following situations:

## Retention of Your Personal Data

**Local Storage**: Most of your personal data is stored locally on your device using SQLite and AsyncStorage. This data remains on your device until you:
- Delete the application
- Manually delete data from the application
- Perform a factory reset of your device

**Google Drive Backup (Optional)**: If you choose to use the Google Drive backup functionality, backup files are stored in your Google Drive account. You can delete these backups at any time from your Google Drive account or from the application.

The Company will retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

**Primary Storage**: Your personal data is stored primarily on your local device. **We do not transfer your personal data to external servers**, except in the optional case of Google Drive backup.

**Google Drive Backup (Optional)**: If you choose to use the Google Drive backup functionality, your data may be transferred and stored on Google's servers, which may be located outside your country of residence. By using this functionality, you agree that your data may be transferred to Google's servers according to Google's privacy policies.

**Firebase Remote Config**: Communication with Firebase Remote Config only involves reading configuration values. No personal data is transferred to Firebase.

Your information may be transferred to and stored on computers located outside your country where data protection laws may differ. By accepting this Policy and using optional cloud backup functionalities, you agree to such transfer.

## Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your Personal Data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Security Measures Implemented:**

- **Encrypted Local Storage**: Data is stored locally on your device using SQLite, which provides a basic level of protection.

- **PIN Authentication**: Your PIN is stored as a SHA256 hash, never in plain text. This means that even if someone accesses the database, they cannot see your original PIN.

- **Biometric Authentication**: We offer support for Face ID (iOS) and Touch ID / fingerprint (Android) as an additional authentication method. Biometric data is managed by your device's operating system and is never stored in our application.

- **Security Questions**: Answers to security questions are also stored as SHA256 hashes.

- **Optional Backup**: If you use the Google Drive backup functionality, files are stored in your Google Drive account, which is protected by Google's security measures.

**Security Recommendations:**
- Use a strong PIN (4-6 digits)
- Enable biometric authentication if your device supports it
- Set up security questions for PIN recovery
- Keep your device protected with a passcode or pattern
- Perform regular backups of your data

Our Service **is not directed to children under 13 years of age** (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to consent to the processing of personal data).

If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
